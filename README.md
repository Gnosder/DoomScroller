# DoomScroller WIP
 Endless doom, all thanks to the mainstream news!

This project was inspired by ["The Endless Doomscroller"] (https://endlessdoomscroller.com/) by Ben Grosser.

The news is hardly ever uplifting. In fact, it's often down-right depressing. This isn't because the world is a horrible place full of horrible people, but because ill-omens and dour outlooks move more page views then puppies and rainbows(this is strange to me, but I suppose I'm no expert). Despite all this DOOM it can be hard to see just how bad things are(or seem to be) when reading through your local news paper(or web-page, or twitter feed, or however you get your news). I wanted to get a more solid view of the current news-scape and the Doomscroller does just that, it agregates headlines from across news outlets and displays them in a list. But. It only displays the headline, not the sub-header, not a summary, not the article, just the headline.

How does this differ from the Doomscroler linked above? Simple. That one uses a pre-set list of headlines, mine doesn't.
